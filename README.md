<h1 align= "center">Moved</h1>

Due to U.S. trade controls law restrictions and MKware's location in "U.S.-sanctioned region", Github has closed access to private repositories and couple of other things for this account. As a result, I had to move all repositories to other git hosting.


New location of repositories: [https://git.sr.ht/~mkware/](https://git.sr.ht/~mkware/)


All repositories will remain here, however, they will no longer be updated until U.S. government changes their mind.
